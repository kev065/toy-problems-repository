Challenge 2 - Speed Detector Toy Problem 
The goal of the speed detector toy problem is to write a program that can check the speed of a car and display a message accordingly. If the speed is below 70 km/h, the message should say "Ok". Otherwise, the program should count how many demerit points the driver has earned based on the speed and show the message with the number of points. For every 5 km/h over the limit (70 km/h), the driver gets one point. If the driver has more than 12 points, their license should be suspended.
